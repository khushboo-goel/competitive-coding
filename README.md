Questions practiced for Interview Preparation

Notes:
1. This repo does not contain the full code. It has only function specific to the logic of the problem solving.
2. Questions and additional resources are attached in the file itself.

### Learnings:
1. For graph algorithms, undirected graphs uses `visited` approach vs directed graph uses `indegree` approach to traverse a graph.
2. You need to count all nodes traversed to detect `cycle` in a graph (mainly in Topological Sorting). If no of nodes traversed is not total nodes, there is either a connection break or cycle.
